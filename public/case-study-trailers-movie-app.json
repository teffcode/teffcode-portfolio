These users confirmed initial assumptions about the challenges faced by foreign users when it comes to understanding movies before purchasing tickets. Research revealed that language barriers and unfamiliarity with local cinema offerings were common issues. As a UX Designer, I focused on designing a user-friendly interface that provided multilingual movie trailers, plot summaries, and information on nearby theaters. The goal was to enable these users to make informed decisions about movie selections, overcoming language obstacles and ensuring a better movie-going experience."
